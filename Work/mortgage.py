# Dave has decided to take out a 30-year fixed rate mortgage of $500,000 with Guido’s Mortgage, Stock Investment, and Bitcoin trading corporation. The interest rate is 5% and the monthly payment is $2684.11.


principal = 500000.0
rate = 0.05
payment = 2684.11
total_paid = 0.0
month = 0

extra_payment = 1000.0
extra_payment_start_month = 61  
extra_payment_end_month = 108

while principal > 0:
    month = month + 1
    principal = principal * (1+rate/12) - payment
    total_paid = total_paid + payment
    
    if month >= extra_payment_start_month and month <= extra_payment_end_month:
        principal = principal - extra_payment
        total_paid = total_paid + extra_payment

    print(month, round(total_paid,2), round(principal,2))

print('Total paid', round(total_paid,2))
print('Months', month)
